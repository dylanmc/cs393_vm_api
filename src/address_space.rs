// Most OS code uses doubly-linked lists to store sparse data structures like
// an address space's mappings.
// Using Rust's built-in LinkedLists is fine. See https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/struct.LinkedList.html
// But if you really want to get the zen of Rust, this is a really good read, written by the original author
// of that very data structure: https://rust-unofficial.github.io/too-many-lists/

// So, feel free to come up with a different structure, either a classic Rust collection,
// from a crate (but remember it needs to be #no_std compatible), or even write your own.
// See this ticket from Riley: https://github.com/dylanmc/cs393_vm_api/issues/10
